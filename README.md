# Delivery_delay_Analysis

🚚 Delivery Delay Analytics Dashboard

Analyze and optimize last-mile delivery delays for a fast-paced e-commerce logistics platform (inspired by Blinkit/Zepto).

📌 Overview

This project simulates real-world delivery operations and uncovers key delay factors using:

Python for data cleaning and feature engineering

SQL Server for structured querying and creating analytical views

Power BI for an interactive two-page dashboard

The dashboard visualizes KPIs like delivery delay trends, agent performance, traffic and festival impact, and helps drive operational insights.

🧰 Tools Used

Python (Pandas, Seaborn) — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

SQL Server — Querying and building reusable views

Power BI — Dashboard creation and visual storytelling

📊 Dashboard Summary

🔹 Page 1: Delivery Performance Overview

KPI Cards: Total Orders, Avg Delay, On-Time %

Bar Charts: Delay by Time of Day, Delay by Traffic

Stacked Column Chart: Delayed vs On-Time Orders

Table: Top 5 Delayed Drop Areas

🔹 Page 2: Delivery Delay Analysis

Festival vs Non-Festival Delays

Matrix: Combined Impact of Festival + Traffic

Order Value vs Delay Range

Bar Chart: Avg Delay by Day of Week

Table: Top 5 Fastest Delivery Agents

🔍 Key Insights

Festival periods see the highest average delays, especially under medium/high traffic conditions.

Late-night deliveries (low traffic) still experience notable delays, indicating workforce shortages or process inefficiencies.

Drop areas like [Top 3 Delayed Areas] consistently underperform—ideal for route optimization.

Top 5 agents show 30–40% lower delay averages, highlighting potential for training and replication.

✅ How to Use

Run Delivery_Analysis.ipynb to simulate, clean, and engineer delivery data

Import Delivery.sql in SQL Server to create the delivery_data table

Run Delivery_views.sql to define SQL views for key insights

Open Power BI → Get Data from SQL Server → Load views

Build and customize visuals using pre-written views

📌 Optional Extensions

Integrate live traffic/weather APIs for real-time delay prediction

Use DAX to build advanced KPIs (like Delay % by Distance Bucket)

Embed the dashboard in a web app with Streamlit or Power BI Service

Made with ❤️ to solve real-world delivery challenges.
